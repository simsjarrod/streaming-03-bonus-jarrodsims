# Project Title: 44671 Module 3 Streaming Bonus Project
## Jarrod Sims


## Project Description
In this project, we'll look how a message broker can be used to allow processes to work independently (decoupled). This is critical as a system scales. Specifically this project utilizes RabbitMQ to create a producer that reads from a CSV file and writes messages to a new queue every 1-3 seconds. A consumer then reads those messages from this queue, and writes the messages to a new file.

## Prerequisites

1. Git
1. Python 3.7+ (3.11+ preferred)
1. VS Code Editor
1. VS Code Extension: Python (by Microsoft)
1. RabbitMQ Server installed and running locally


## Verify Installations / Update Default Python

Create a Python Virtual Environment

We will create a local Python virtual environment to isolate our project's third-party dependencies from other projects.

1. Open a terminal window in VS Code.
1. Use the built-in Python utility venv to create a new virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Verify you get a new .venv directory in your project. 
We use .venv as the name to keep it away from our project files. 

## Activate the Virtual Environment

In the same VS Code terminal window, activate the virtual environment.

- On Windows, run: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
- On Linux/MacOS, run: `source .venv/bin/activate`

Verify you see the virtual environment name (.venv) in your terminal prompt.

## Install Dependencies into the Virtual Environment

To work with RabbitMQ, we need to install the pika library.
A library is a collection of code that we can use in our own code.
Learning to use free libraries that others have written to make our projects easier, faster, more reliable is a key skill for a developer.

We keep the list of third-party libraries needed in a file named requirements.txt.
Use the pip utility to install the libraries listed in requirements.txt into our active virtual environment. 

Make sure you can see the .venv name in your terminal prompt before running this command.

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Verify Setup

In your VS Code terminal window, run the following commands to help verify your setup.
These util files MAY be helpful to ensure you're setup correctly. 
You may have a different configuration and RabbitMQ may still work; the check looks in common places, but may not work for all installations. 
They are meant to be helpful, but are not required.

```shell
python util_about.py
python util_aboutenv.py
python util_aboutrabbit.py
pip list
```
